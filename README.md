## What this repository contains

This repository is intended to contain the public launcher-side framework for DroidBridge Launcher, including Android UI, settings, instance management, renderer configuration, input handling, legal screens, and compatibility scaffolding.

Depending on the branch, release, or build configuration, this repository may include experimental or in-progress launcher components.

The public project focuses on:

- Android-native launcher UI and instance management.
- Local launcher settings and instance state management.
- Version metadata models and compatibility structures.
- Java runtime and LWJGL integration scaffolding for Android.
- Renderer/runtime compatibility work for Android devices.
- Touch, input, surface, and lifecycle bridge work required to run Java games on Android.
- Mod, modpack, resource pack, shader pack, and world management UI/framework code.
- Legal, privacy, and open-source notice screens.

---

## What this repository must not contain

Do **not** commit private or user-specific configuration.

The public source tree must not include:

- private authentication credentials;
- production signing keys or keystores;
- private API keys;
- user account tokens or session data;
- local machine paths such as Android SDK paths;
- bundled Minecraft game files, assets, libraries, or proprietary content;
- private endpoint details;
- private production service implementation code; or
- private release-only launcher implementation classes.

Keep private configuration in local files that are ignored by Git.

Recommended private files:

```text
local.properties
keystore.properties
signing.properties
secrets.properties
.env
*.jks
*.keystore
```

## Microsoft account sign-in clarification

Some private or production builds of DroidBridge Launcher may allow users to sign in with a Microsoft account through Microsoft identity services.

A working Microsoft sign-in flow, registered application, redirect URI, or consent screen means only that the launcher uses Microsoft identity services for authentication where that feature is available. It does **not** mean Mojang, Microsoft, Xbox, or Minecraft has approved, endorsed, sponsored, reviewed, or partnered with this launcher.

This public source release does not provide production account-service configuration, private token exchange details, app secrets, private endpoint details, or release-only authentication implementation code.

## License and source availability

This repository is a mixed-origin source tree.

Files written entirely by DNA Mobile Applications may be licensed separately by DNA Mobile Applications.

Files copied from, modified from, derived from, or based on third-party projects remain subject to their original licenses and notices. That includes files derived from PojavLauncher, Boardwalk, LWJGL, Mesa, GL4ES, Android platform libraries, and other third-party components.

If this repository includes PojavLauncher-derived code, the applicable LGPL-covered source code and modifications must remain available under the LGPL terms.

Before distributing APKs or other binaries, make sure the app includes or links to:

- open-source notices;
- required license texts;
- source-code links required by LGPL/GPL or other applicable licenses;
- the app privacy policy;
- the app terms/legal notice screen; and
- any notices required by files copied or modified from third-party projects.

This README is not legal advice. Review the relevant licenses before commercial distribution or app-store publication.

## Privacy

DroidBridge Launcher is designed to avoid operating a DNA Mobile Applications account server.

Launcher settings, logs, worlds, mods, resource packs, shader packs, and launcher files are intended to remain local to the user’s device unless the user chooses to share, export, upload, or send them through another service.

See `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` for the full privacy policy.

## App icon in this README

The icon at the top of this README expects this file to exist:

```text
docs/app_icon.png
```

Before publishing, place the PNG app icon at that path so GitHub displays it correctly.

---

## Building

Open the project in Android Studio and let Gradle sync.

Typical local build commands:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

On Windows:

```bat
gradlew.bat assembleDebug
gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

Release builds should be signed with the correct production keystore and should not include debug-only application IDs, private API keys, local paths, or private development configuration.
